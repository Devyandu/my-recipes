        For best results, use strongly flavored olives, not canned ripe olives, for these puff pastry-wrapped olives. "The flavor of canned olives disappears in the puff pastry," says Syd. "We make them with a variety of pitted olives -- pimento-stuffed green, plump kalamata, Provencal. They are our family's favorite holiday appetizer."
